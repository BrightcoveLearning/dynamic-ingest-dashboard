                <h1>Notifications</h1>
                <h3>For the Dynamic Ingest and CMS APIs</h3>
                <p>Both the Dynamic Ingest and CMS APIs have notification services. In the case of the Dynamic Ingest API, notifications provide information about the progress of your ingest jobs. The CMS API provides notifications of changes to the videos in your account, whether made by an account user or the Video Cloud system. This document explains how to receive notifications and the kinds of information contained in them.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="section" id="diAPI">
                <h2>Dynamic Ingest API</h2>
                <p>You can specify a one or more callback URLs to receive notifications of the results of the ingest process. The URLs you specify should be for apps than can accept POST requests. Notifications will be sent in JSON format.</p>
                <p class="BCL-aside">Note: up to 10 subscribers for error notifications are supported. You can include more than 10 URLs to have notifications sent to, but only the first 10 will be processed.</p>
                <h3>Setup</h3>
                <p>Here’s an example. For a user with pub id 1234567890123 who wants to use Dynamic Ingest to upload a source video file located at https://s3.amazonaws.com/bucket/mysourcevideo.mp4 to an existing title in the catalog with video id 99988877766655 using the balanced-high-definition profile and who, furthermore, wants to receive callbacks at two endpoints located at http://host1/path1 and http://host2/path2 respectively, the DI request would be like this:</p>

<pre><code>POST https://ingest.api.brightcove.com/v1/accounts/1234567890123/videos/99988877766655/ingest-requests { "master": { "url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/bucket/mysourcevideo.mp4" }, "profile": "high-resolution", <strong>"callbacks": ["http://host1/path1”, “http://host2/path2”]</strong> }</code></pre>
                <h3>Sample notification</h3>
                <p>Notifications are sent as POST requests with the notification in the request body as JSON<sup class="once-red"><strong><a href="#note1">[1]</a></strong></sup>. Here is a sample notification:</p>
<pre><code>{
    "entity": "4375977109001",
    "entityType": "TITLE",
    "status": "SUCCESS",
    "version": "1",
    "action": "CREATE"
}</code></pre>
                <h4>Notes</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li id="note1"><sup class="once-red"><strong>[1]</strong></sup> Exception: DRM packaging errors are returned as key/value pairs. In the case the <code>Content-Type</code> header will be <code>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</code> - otherwise, the <code>Content-Type</code> will be <code>application/json</code></li>

                <h3>Interpreting notifications</h3>
                <p>A notification containing <code>"action": "CREATE"</code> and <code>"status": "SUCCESS"</code> indicates completion of a process. If the <code>entityType</code> is <code>TITLE</code>, then processing of an ingested video is complete. If the <code>entityType</code> is <code>ASSET</code>, then a rendition, image, or WebVTT file has been successfully added to your video.</p>

                <h2>CMS API</h2>
                <p>You can receive notifications when <code>video_change</code> events occur in your video library. Notifications will be sent to the URL you specify, which should point to an application capable of handling HTTP POST requests.</p>
                <h3>Setup</h3>
                <p>You can specify up to 10 endpoints to receive notifications by making a POST request to <code>https://cms.api.brightcove.com/v1/accounts/{account_id}/subscriptions</code> and including JSON in the request body like this:</p>
<pre><code>{
    "endpoint":"http://solutions.brightcove.com/bcls/di-api/di-callbacks.php",

                <p>Requests to create a subscription will receive an HTTP 422 error response for the following conditions:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The <code>endpoint</code> or <code>events</code> field is missing from the request body</li>

                </ul>
                <h3>Notification failures</h3>
                <p>The notification system treats any 4xx or 5xx return from the customer server as a retriable failure. Failing callbacks will be retried up to 20 times, with an exponentially increasing delay between subsequent callbacks. The first few retries will happen within minutes of the initial callback attempt. If the callback continues failing, and we get all the way out to the 20th retry, the retry delay will be a few days.</p>
                <p class="BCL-aside">Note:
                    <code>video_change</code> events are triggered by automated system processes as well as user actions, so these events will not always corresponds to changes you made to video properties in Studio or via the APIs.</p>
                <h3>Firewalls</h3>
                <p>In case your organization has a strict policy regarding sources of incoming traffic through your firewall, the following fixed IP addresses are used to send notifications:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>54.84.92.184</li>
                    <li>54.175.126.166</li>
                    <li>54.164.120.55</li>
                </ul>
                <p>These values are subject to change in the future. The IPs are within the AWS ec2 us-east-1 address space and we anticipate that future IP addresses will also be, if you don't want to deal with specific IP address changes, you can configure your firewalls and routing rules to allow traffic from any of us-east-1.</p>
                <h3>Endpoint for notification subscriptions</h3>
                <pre><code>/accounts/{account_id}/subscriptions</code></pre>

                <h3 id="createSubscription">Create a new subscription</h3>
                <p>To create a new subscription, submit a POST request with a request body including the endpoint that you want notifications delivered to and
                    <code>video-change</code> as the single item in an
                    <code>events</code> array:</p>

                <h2>Basic Sample app</h2>
                <p>Below is code for a simple logging app that will work for both CMS API and Dynamic Ingest API notification (which fields get populated will depend on where the notification originated). This app is written in PHP, but you can use any language, as long as the app has a public-facing URL and can handle http(s) POST requests.</p>
                <p>
                    You can see the log file that this app generates <a href="//solutions.brightcove.com/bcls/di-api/di-log.txt">here.</a>
                </p>
                <p class="BCL-aside">Note: if you try to implement this app for yourself, you will need to make sure that the app has permission to write to your log file. Also remember that the log file can grow quickly - you will probably want to empty it on a regular basis.</p>

                <h2>Dynamic Ingest dashboard</h2>
                <p>This section explains a more advanced sample of using notifications to build a simple dashboard for the Dynamic Ingest API. The handler for notifications is similar to sample PHP app above, but in this case it parses notifications from the Dynamic Ingest API to identify processing complete notifications. It then adds the video id into an array in a JavaScript file. The dashboard itself is an HTML page that includes the array of processed video ids. It uses the ids to makes 2 requests to the <a href="../../cms-api/getting-started/quick-start-cms.html">CMS API</a> to get the video metadata and the array of sources (renditions). Whether renditions exist or not shows whether the ingest succeeded or failed. You can view the dashboard <a href="//solutions.brightcove.com/bcls/di-api/di-log.html">here</a>.</p>
                <p>
                    Here is the high-level architecture of the app:

                <p><img src="./assets/ingestion-dashboard-architecture.png" alt="ingest-dashboard-architecture"></p>
                <h3>The app parts</h3>
                <p>The handler for notifications is built in PHP - it looks for processing complete notifications and adds the video id to an array in a separate JavaScript file:</p>
                <h4>Notification handler</h4>
                <p><script src="https://gist.github.com/846bf4f1b8d52b442121.js"></script></p>
                <h4>JavaScript file:</h4>
                <p><script src="https://gist.github.com/c4b36c1f826762be75f9.js"></script></p>
                <h4>Dashboard</h4>
                <p>The dashboard include the JavaScript file, and uses additional JavaScript to fetch data from the CMS API and write the results into a table:</p>
                <p><script src="https://gist.github.com/5f93d0f1fae7c4666867.js"></script></p>
                <h4>Proxy</h4>
                <p>The proxy, also built in PHP, takes the CMS API requests from the dashboard, gets an access token, and makes the API request, returning the data to the dashboard. The proxy is needed because client-side calls to the CMS-API are not allowed, as this would require exposing your client credentials:</p>
                <p><script src="https://gist.github.com/b0d5f05a328840851ce5.js"></script></p>
                <h4>Clear the log</h4>
                <p>This simple PHP app just restores the JavaScript file to its original state, clearing out the old video ids:</p>
